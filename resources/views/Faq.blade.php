                                        <p>The top load type, where clothes are washed from the top, is more suitable for elderly users and people with lumbar problems because there is no need to bend over and load the clothes like front load. If you want to use the front load without back pain problems, you can use a washing machine stand around 12 - 15 inches high.
                                            Another thing is that the top load type allows you to add more clothes while the washing machine is running. In addition, clothes can be easily picked up, and the use of fabric softener makes all clothes more effective.</p>

Compared to top loads, front load types require regular maintenance. For front load users, the washing machine should be placed in a well ventilated area, and the front door should be slightly ajar when the washing machine is being used.</p>
